# Using the module

# Google Oauth
In order to use this module, you need to create google Oauth client id credentials on the Google Cloud API console. Ideally, you should create a new project on the cloud console. Note that this is free so long as you utilize the Google Sheets API under the specifications listed [here](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/limits). Once you created the Oauth credential take note of the client id and client secret. You should take care to keep these private!
